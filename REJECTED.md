CONSIDERED AND REJECTED IDEAS
=============================
`-l` long fmt for `ls` refugees.  The first thing I expect a new `lc` user to do
is decide what fields (& what order) they want for their `lc -sl`.  I strongly
suspect that will have combinatorially many different answers.  Also, I use `-l`
for something else right now although that could change.  It is a boolean flag
and doesn't outright fail.  As a guide, configs/cb0/style has "gls", though.

--------

So called --tree formats.  These don't interoperate very well with the simple
"one directory at a time" recursive structure of `proc ls`.  Unlike process
trees with usually few kids, there are often O(screenful) numbers of dents.
So, it's easy to lose track of alignment visually.  In as small scale as tree
likely works well in, many other things also probably work fine.  I.e., it's
value add is marginal.  It makes more sense in GUIs where you pick and choose
points of collapse or expansion.  There are likely other problems.

--------

Miller columns/cascading lists.  What people want here is (approximately):
```
paste <(lc -1m25 ../..) <(lc -1m25 ..) <(lc -1m25 .) | less -x26

```
Doing this for one-off single directories can already be achieved with the above
snippet.  So, I doubt it makes sense as a built-in `lc` feature.  It's likely
enough to do a script with the above pipeline (being aware of how deep '.' is,
taking a number of levels, adding thatDir/../.. when needed, etc.)  `lc -mN` is
better than other file listers for this application, since you can bound the
width (but not "height") of each listing being pasted ahead of time.  So, you
can also know how many side-by-side major columns fit in $COLUMNS for a given
bound.  There are no scrollbars, exactly, but the terminal as a whole may have
them or a user can pipe the output to a pager.  Also note that fixed widths
like `-m25` cannot guarantee unique pattern expansions.  About all a built-in
`lc` feature might add would be i-node (vs. string) identification of where to
put some kind of "indicator string" to guide how levels of the hierarchy connect
(E.g. a `**` after the right entry in the parent and parent-parent listings.)
