Getting an `lc` config going *should* be as easy as (on Debian):
```
apt install nim  #(https://nim-lang.org/ has other options)
nimble install lc
git clone https://github.com/c-blake/lc
cp -r lc/configs/cb0 $HOME/.config/lc
$HOME/.nimble/bin/lc    #-h gives a large help message
```
The Nim experience can sometimes have fairly rough-hewn edges, though.  So far,
though, something like the above has worked for me on Gentoo Linux, Debian,
Android Termux, and FreeBSD.

What `lc` is Not
================
This program is not and never will be a drop-in replacement for `ls` at the CLI
option compatibility level.  `ls` is a poorly factored mishmash of selection,
sorting, and formatting options.  With fewer CLI options (but beefier configs)
`lc` is many-fold more flexible.  It can create similar output, but my main
impetus to write `lc` was always a better functionality factoring not mere
recapitulation.  So, `lc` is *not* just "ls in Nim".  If you want `ls`, it has
big companies supporting it & isn't going anywhere.

`lc` is also not `stat` or `find`.  Those have their roles for spot-checking or
generating program-consumed data streams.  `lc` is about human-friendly output,
helping you see and/or create organization you want in your file sets and shine
light on unexpected things as you go about everyday business listing your files.
As such, absolute max performance is not a priority as human reaction time is
not so fast & very large directories are usually ill-advised.

What `lc` is
============
Enough disclaimers about what `lc` is *not*.  What *is* `lc`?  Why do we need
yet another file lister?  What's the point?  Well, `lc`

 - is clearly factored into independent actions and very configurable

 - has good CLI ergonomics (unique prefixes good enough, spellcheck, etc.)

 - supports multi-level sorting for many forward/reverse attributes

 - supports arbitrary assignment of "file kind order" for use in sorting

 - supports "multi-dimensional reasoning" about file kinds, including both
   text attribute layers and an "icon vector" (for utf8 "icons", anyway)

 - supports both latter-day nanosecond file times and *very* abbreviated ages

 - has value-dependent coloring for file times, sizes, permissions, etc.

 - can emit "hyperlink" escape codes to make entries clickable in some terminals

 - supports file/user/group/link target abbreviation via `-mNum`, `-ma`, etc.

 - supports "local tweak files" - extra config options in a local `.lc` (or a
   `.lc` in a shadow tree under a user's control if needed).  Nice to eg, avoid
   NFS automounts or inversely to engage expensive classification, for dirs with
   special sorting or filtering needs, etc., etc.

 - supports "theming" (operationally, environment-variable-keyed cfg includes)

 - supports latter-day Linux statx/b)irth times (but works on non-Linux, too)

 - supports `file(1)`/`libmagic` deep file inspection-based classification
   (though using this with large directories can be woefully slow)

 - is extensible with fully user-defined file type tests & field formats

 - is compact (~1000 lines; ~300 is tables&help, ~300 of `cligen/[tab, humanUt]`
               might be part of `lc` if I didn't write both pkgs.)

 - has few dependencies (just `cligen` and the Nim stdlib)

 - is a work in progress, but a unique enough bundle of useful ideas to share.
   With so many features and just me as a user, there are surely many bugs.

Multi-dimensionality/Attribute Layers
=====================================
The most obscure of these is likely "multi-dimensional".  I mean this in the
mathematical "independent coordinate" sense **not** a Jurassic Park (1993)-esque
graphical file tree sense.  Examples of dimensions may help.  One file can be
both an executable regular file and some kind of script source.  Or both a
directory and a directory with a sticky bit set.  On the output side, you can
also set the foreground & background colors of text independently (as well as
blinking, and so on).  I happen to like [st](https://git.suckless.org/st/) for
its hackability which supports bold, italic, blink, underline, struck, inverse
all as 6 independent text attributes. (Color inversion involves a mapping likely
too complex to be a useful visual aid.)  So, 7 usable output dimensions, with 5
being shallow 1-bit dimensions.  Though subjective, I find text with all these
embellishments at once legible on my primary displays.  Geographical map people
often call this "layers".  `lc` aids "aligning" rendering or output dimensions
with classification or input dimensions.

On the input/data side there are a few natural "query" dimensions such as traits
based on dtype data, stat data, ACLs, .., that performance-sensitive folk may
like, but there are also *many* independent fields & bits just in `struct stat`.
Not much is mutually exclusive like the dtype.  So, `lc` users can configure
however many classification dimensions to line up against their picked poisons
of output dimensions.  Operationally, users just pick small integer labels for
dimensions/series of order-dependent tests.  The first test passing within a
given dimension wins that dimension.  To aid debugging kind assignments you can
do things like `lc -f%0%1%2%3%4%5\ %f` to see coordinates in the first 6 dims.

Configurability
===============
As for the bread and butter of file listing, many things that are hard-coded in
other file listers are fully user-defined in `lc`, like a concept of dot files.
Assuming you define a "dot" or "dotfile" type `lc -xdot` will probably exclude
those from a listing.  (Unique prefixes being adequate may mean a longer string
if you define other file kinds with names starting with "dot".)  I usually have
a shell alias that does the `-xdot` and a related alias ending with an "a" that
does not.  That mimics `ls` usage, but without spaces and '-'s to enter.  If the
listing is well organized, seeing dot files by default may be considered as much
a feature as a bug.  Including everything by default lets "dot" be user-defined.
You can also do `-idot` to see *only* the dot files (or any other user/system
defined file kind) which is not something available in most file listers.  It's
also not always easy to replicate via shell globbing the input list.  Eg., `lc
-r0 -idir -iodd` can often be illuminating on very aged file trees.

Multi-level sorting and user format strings are similar ideas to other tools
like the Linux `ps`, `stat -c`, and `find -printf`.  Sorting by file kind is
possible and "kind orders" are user-configurable.  Between kind order assignment
and multi-dimensionality you can filter & group almost any way that makes sense,
and none of that needs any changing of `lc` proper - just your configuration.
Less can be more with good factoring.  `lc` is almost an "`ls`-Construction
toolkit".

Because of all that flexibility, `lc` has a built in style/aliasing system.
This lets you name canned queries & reports and refer to them, like `lc -sl`.
My view is that there is no one-size-fits-all-or-even-most long-format listing.
`ls -sl` or a shorter `ll='lc -sl'` alias is the way to go.  Then you can make
columns included (and their `order`, `--header` or not, ..) all just how you
like.  I usually like 5 levels of long-ness, not 2, in my personal setup.

Automatic Abbreviations
=======================
A feature I don't know of any terminal file listers using is abbreviation (GUIs
have this, though and PowerShell9k/10k in single-path prompt contexts).  Most
everyone has probably been annoyed at one time or another by some pesky few
overlong filenames in a directory messing up column widths in a file listing.
`lc -m16` lets you limit displayed length to 16 (or whatever) characters.  `lc`
replaces the (user-definable) "middle slice" with a user-definable string.
While you can use some UTF8 ellipsis, you probably want `*` since that choice
will make most abbreviations valid shell patterns that you can copy-paste.

Manual width & slice selection may not result in patterns that expand uniquely,
but `lc` has you covered with a variety of automatic abbreviation options that
are unique: specified head|tail, mid-point (for those 2 just leave "," fields
blank), unique best-common-point (start width with "a"), unique prefix (-2) or
suffix (-3), the shorter \*fix (-4), the shortest 1-star-anywhere (-5) and
shortest 2-star (-6).  E.g.,

![ma.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-blake/lc/master/screenshots/ma.png)

(or see [a bigger example](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c-blake/lc/master/screenshots/src-linux-script/progression.html) )

There are similar `-U`, `-G`, `-M` for user user names, group names, and symlink
targets.  While shells will not expand `*` in user/group names, you can change
the separator to something else or even the empty string to save terminal
columns as in `-U4,,,` and have a little `grep <PASTE> /etc/passwd` helper.
Auto modes are not yet available for symlink targets since when they matter most
they are a bit expensive (requiring minimizing patterns over whole directories
for every path component).

Some Details On Other Features
==============================
In many little ways, `lc` tries hard to let you manage terminal real estate,
targeting max information per row, while staying within an easy to visually
parse table format.  Features along these lines are terse 4 column octal
permission codes, rounding to 3-column file ages, 4 column file sizes.  If it
succeeds too well you can have fewer, more spaced columns out more with `lc -n4`
or something.  If it succeeds too poorly, you can use `-m`, drop format fields
*or* identify the most effective rename targets with `lc -w5 -W$((COLUMNS+10))`
which shows the widest 5 files in each output column (formatted as if you had
10 more terminal cols).  A hard-to-advocate-but-possible way to save space is
`lc -oL`.  Try it.  { I suspect this minimizes rows within a table constraint,
but the proof is too small to fit in the margin. ;-)  Maybe some 2D bin packing
expert can weigh in with a counter example. }

In the other direction, `lc` supports informational bonuses like ns-resolution
file timestamps with `%1..%9` extensions to the `strftime` format language for
fractions of a second to that many places as per your discretion, rate of disk
utilization (`512*st_blocks/st_size` = allocated/addressable file bytes), as
well as newer Linux `statx` attributes and birth times.

`lc` also comes with boolean logic combiners for file kind tests, quite a few
built-in tests, and is extensible for totally user-defined tests and formats.
So, if there's just a thing or two missing then you can probably add it without
much work.  Given human reading time and fast NVMe devices, even doing "du -s"
inside a format call is not unthinkable, though unlikely to be a popular default
style.  Hard-coding Git support seems popular these days.  I do not do that yet,
and I'm not sure I want the direct dependency, but you may be able to hack
something together.
