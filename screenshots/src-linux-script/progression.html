      Condensing copy-pastable representations of linux-5.2.2/scripts/
    </h1>
  <p> We start at 70 rows and end at 8. (8.75X reduction) with gradual loss of
  readability (obviously subjective vs. the objective space measurement or
  unique pattern expansion). </p>

  <p> Base full name directory (70 rows of 2 cols): </p>
  <img src="0-base.png"  alt="0-base.png" />

  <p> Sort by name length (35 rows of 4 cols) -- this is very fast and typically
  very readable (for me) since it provides max prefix &amp; suffix context: </p>
  <img src="1-oL.png"    alt="1-oL.png" />

  <p> Shortest such that mid-point <code>*</code> produes a unique pattern (35 rows
  of 4 cols): </p>
  <img src="2-m,.png"    alt="2-m,.png" />

  <p> Best same-column-for-<code>*</code> (28 rows of 5 cols) -- this is also
  very fast and typically still readable, but more compact: </p>
  <img src="3-ma.png"    alt="3-ma.png" />

  <p> Shortest unique prefix patterns (28 rows of 5 cols): </p>
  <img src="4-m-2.png"   alt="4-m-2.png" />

  <p> Shortest unique suffix patterns (24 rows of 6 cols): </p>
  <img src="5-m-3.png"   alt="5-m-3.png" />

  <p> Shorter of shortest unique prefix|suffix (18 rows of 8 cols): </p>
  <img src="6-m-4.png"   alt="6-m-4.png" />

  <p> Shortest unique single-<code>*</code> patterns (12 rows of 12 cols): </p>
  <img src="7-m-5.png"   alt="7-m-5.png" />

  <p>Shortest unique two-<code>*</code> patterns (10 rows of 14 cols): </p>
  <img src="8-m-6.png"   alt="8-m-6.png" />

  <p>Shortest unique two-<code>*</code> patterns, sorted by length (8 rows of
  18 cols): </p>
  <img src="9-m-6oL.png" alt="9-m-6oL.png" />

  <p>Note that the shortest 3-star patterns distinct from 2-star patterns must
  be at least 5 chars (*a*b*).  The above listing tops out at 5 chars.  So, no
  further compression is possible.  <code>lc</code> does not actually do 3-star
  patterns, yet, but even if it did this example would stop here.</p>

  One can also pass <code>-F</code> to re-Fit/expand the compressed patterns
  into the available tabular column space "post layout".  So, for example for
  the penultimate case above we get: </p>
  <img src="10-Fm-6.png" alt="10-Fm-6.png" />

  Skipped for brevity, but with <code>-m-4</code> compression <code>-F</code>
  winds up <em>fully</em> expanding 20% of dirents at no layout cost.

  On directories with thousands of entries or more that <code>-m-[456]</code>
  can take from 10 seconds to <em>minutes</em>.  I am unsure much faster algos
  exist.  Sadly, large dirs are also when this kind of visual compression might
  help most.  However, <code>-Fma</code> may be the most that remains easily
  interpretable anyway and that is always fast.
